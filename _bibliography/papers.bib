  title = {Variations in Glycogen Synthesis in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells with Altered Pluripotent States},
  journal = {{PLOS} {ONE}},
  abbr = {chen2015variations.png},
  abstract = {Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent very promising resources for cell-based regenerative medicine. It is essential to determine the biological implications of some fundamental physiological processes (such as glycogen metabolism) in these stem cells. In this report, we employ electron, immunofluorescence microscopy, and biochemical methods to study glycogen synthesis in hPSCs. Our results indicate that there is a high level of glycogen synthesis (0.28 to 0.62 μg/μg proteins) in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) compared with the glycogen levels (0 to 0.25 μg/μg proteins) reported in human cancer cell lines. Moreover, we found that glycogen synthesis was regulated by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) and the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) pathway. Our observation of glycogen bodies and sustained expression of the pluripotent factor Oct-4 mediated by the potent GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 reveals an altered pluripotent state in hPSC culture. We further confirmed glycogen variations under different naïve pluripotent cell growth conditions based on the addition of the GSK-3 inhibitor BIO. Our data suggest that primed hPSCs treated with naïve growth conditions acquire altered pluripotent states, similar to those naïve-like hPSCs, with increased glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, we found that suppression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase was an underlying mechanism responsible for altered glycogen synthesis. Thus, our novel findings regarding the dynamic changes in glycogen metabolism provide new markers to assess the energetic and various pluripotent states in hPSCs. The components of glycogen metabolic pathways offer new assays to delineate previously unrecognized properties of hPSCs under different growth conditions.},

  journal = {The International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging},
  abstract = {Resting regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) has significant prognostic value beyond the findings of computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography. Stretch quantification of endocardial engraved zones (SQUEEZ) has been proposed as a measure of regional cardiac function. The purpose of the work reported here was to determine the effect of lowering the radiation dose on the precision of automatic SQUEEZ assessments of RWMA. Chronic myocardial infarction was created by a 2-h occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 10 swine (heart rates 80–100, ejection fraction 25–57%). CT was performed 5–11 months post infarct using first-pass contrast enhanced segmented cardiac function scans on a 320-detector row scanner at 80 kVp/500 mA. Images were reconstructed at end diastole and end systole with both filtered back projection and using the “standard” adaptive iterative dose reduction (AIDR) algorithm. For each acquisition, 9 lower dose acquisitions were created. End systolic myocardial function maps were calculated using SQUEEZ for all noise levels and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between the left ventricle blood and myocardium was calculated as a measure of image quality. For acquisitions with CNR > 4, SQUEEZ could be estimated with a precision of ± 0.04 (p < 0.001) or 5.7% of its dynamic range. The difference between SQUEEZ values calculated from AIDR and FBP images was not statistically significant. Regional wall motion abnormality can be quantified with good precision from low dose acquisitions, using SQUEEZ, as long as the blood-myocardium CNR stays above 4.},

  abstract = {To realize the full potential of deep learning for medical imaging, large annotated datasets are required for training. Such datasets are difficult to acquire due to privacy issues, lack of experts available for annotation, underrepresentation of rare conditions, and poor standardization. The lack of annotated data has been addressed in conventional vision applications using synthetic images refined via unsupervised adversarial training to look like real images. However, this approach is difficult to extend to general medical imaging because of the complex and diverse set of features found in real human tissues. We propose a novel framework that uses a reverse flow, where adversarial training is used to make real medical images more like synthetic images, and clinically-relevant features are preserved via self-regularization. These domain-adapted synthetic-like images can then be accurately interpreted by networks trained on large datasets of synthetic medical images. We implement this approach on the notoriously difficult task of depth-estimation from monocular endoscopy which has a variety of applications in colonoscopy, robotic surgery, and invasive endoscopic procedures. We train a depth estimator on a large data set of synthetic images generated using an accurate forward model of an endoscope and an anatomically-realistic colon. Our analysis demonstrates that the structural similarity of endoscopy depth estimation in a real pig colon predicted from a network trained solely on synthetic data improved by 78.7% by using reverse domain adaptation.},

  title = {Deep Learning with Cinematic Rendering: Fine-Tuning Deep Neural Networks using Photorealistic Medical Images},
  journal = {Physics in Medicine {\&} Biology},
  abstract = {Deep learning has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence tool to interpret medical images for a growing variety of applications. However, the paucity of medical imaging data with high-quality annotations that is necessary for training such methods ultimately limits their performance. Medical data is challenging to acquire due to privacy issues, shortage of experts available for annotation, limited representation of rare conditions and cost. This problem has previously been addressed by using synthetically generated data. However, networks trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data. Cinematic rendering simulates the propagation and interaction of light passing through tissue models reconstructed from CT data, enabling the generation of photorealistic images. In this paper, we present one of the first applications of cinematic rendering in deep learning, in which we propose to fine-tune synthetic data-driven networks using cinematically rendered CT data for the task of monocular depth estimation in endoscopy. Our experiments demonstrate that: (a) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on synthetic data and fine-tuned on photorealistic cinematically rendered data adapt better to real medical images and demonstrate more robust performance when compared to networks with no fine-tuning, (b) these fine-tuned networks require less training data to converge to an optimal solution, and (c) fine-tuning with data from a variety of photorealistic rendering conditions of the same scene prevents the network from learning patient-specific information and aids in generalizability of the model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that networks fine-tuned with cinematically rendered data predict depth with 56.87% less error for rendered endoscopy images and 27.49% less error for real porcine colon endoscopy images.},

  abstract = {Automated detection of cancer metastases in lymph nodes has the potential to improve the assessment of prognosis for patients. To enable fair comparison between the algorithms for this purpose, we set up the CAMELYON17 challenge in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 Conference in Melbourne. Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted a total of 37 algorithms before the initial deadline. Participants were provided with 899 whole-slide images (WSIs) for developing their algorithms. The developed algorithms were evaluated based on the test set encompassing 100 patients and 500 WSIs. The evaluation metric used was a quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa. We discuss the algorithmic details of the 10 best pre-conference and two post-conference submissions. All these participants used convolutional neural networks in combination with pre- and postprocessing steps. Algorithms differed mostly in neural network architecture, training strategy, and pre- and postprocessing methodology. Overall, the kappa metric ranged from 0.89 to -0.13 across all submissions. The best results were obtained with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet. Confusion matrix analysis revealed that all participants struggled with reliably identifying isolated tumor cells, the smallest type of metastasis, with detection rates below 40%. Qualitative inspection of the results of the top participants showed categories of false positives, such as nerves or contamination, which could be targeted for further optimization. Last, we show that simple combinations of the top algorithms result in higher kappa metric values than any algorithm individually, with 0.93 for the best combination.},

  abstract = {Nuclei mymargin segmentation is a fundamental task for various computational pathology applications including nuclei morphology analysis, cell type classification, and cancer grading. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach to segmenting nuclei but the accuracy of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) depends on the volume and the quality of labeled histopathology data for training. In particular, conventional CNN-based approaches lack structured prediction capabilities, which are required to distinguish overlapping and clumped nuclei. Here, we present an approach to nuclei segmentation that overcomes these challenges by utilizing a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) trained with synthetic and real data. We generate a large dataset of H&E training images with perfect nuclei segmentation labels using an unpaired GAN framework. This synthetic data along with real histopathology data from six different organs are used to train a conditional GAN with spectral normalization and gradient penalty for nuclei segmentation. This adversarial regression framework enforces higher-order spacial-consistency when compared to conventional CNN models. We demonstrate that this nuclei segmentation approach generalizes across different organs, sites, patients and disease states, and outperforms conventional approaches, especially in isolating individual and overlapping nuclei.},

  abstract={Monocular depth estimation is an extensively studied computer vision problem with a vast variety of applications. Deep learning-based methods have demonstrated promise for both supervised and unsupervised depth estimation from monocular images. Most existing approaches treat depth estimation as a regression problem with a local pixel-wise loss function. In this work, we innovate beyond existing approaches by using adversarial training to learn a context-aware, non-local loss function. Such an approach penalizes the joint configuration of predicted depth values at the patch-level instead of the pixel-level, which allows networks to incorporate more global information. In this framework, the generator learns a mapping between RGB images and its corresponding depth map, while the discriminator learns to distinguish depth map and RGB pairs from ground truth. This conditional GAN depth estimation framework is stabilized using spectral normalization to prevent mode collapse when learning from diverse datasets. We test this approach using a diverse set of generators that include U-Net and joint CNN-CRF. We benchmark this approach on the NYUv2, Make3D and KITTI datasets, and observe that adversarial training reduces relative error by several fold, achieving state-of-the-art performance.},

We present a SLAM approach that incorporates depth predictions made by an adversarially-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to monocular endoscopy images. The depth network is trained with synthetic images of a simple colon model, and then fine-tuned with domain-randomized, photorealistic images rendered from computed tomography measurements of human colons. Each image is paired with an error-free depth map for supervised adversarial learning. Monocular RGB images are then fused with corresponding depth predictions, enabling dense reconstruction and mosaicing as an endoscope is advanced through the gastrointestinal tract.

  abstract = {Cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response predictions are based on morphological information from histology slides and molecular profiles from genomic data. However, most deep learning-based objective outcome prediction and grading paradigms are based on histology or genomics alone and do not make use of the complementary information in an intuitive manner. In this work, we propose Pathomic Fusion, an interpretable strategy for end-to-end multimodal fusion of histology image and genomic (mutations, CNV, RNASeq) features for survival outcome prediction. Our approach models pairwise feature interactions across modalities by taking the Kronecker product of unimodal feature representations, and controls the expressiveness of each representation via a gatingbased attention mechanism. Following supervised learning, we are able to interpret and saliently localize features across each modality, and understand how feature importance shifts when conditioning on multimodal input. We validate our approach using glioma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which contains paired wholeslide image, genotype, and transcriptome data with ground truth survival and histologic grade labels. In a 15-fold cross-validation, our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal fusion paradigm improves prognostic determinations from ground truth grading and molecular subtyping, as well as unimodal deep networks trained on histology and genomic data alone. The proposed method establishes insight and theory on how to train deep networks on multimodal biomedical data in an intuitive manner, which will be useful for other problems in medicine that seek to combine heterogeneous data streams for understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to treatment.

However, most prognostic models are either based on histology or genomics alone and do not address how histology and genomics can be integrated to develop joint image-omic prognostic models. Additionally identifying explainable morphological and molecular descriptors from these models that govern such prognosis is of interest. We used multimodal deep learning to integrate gigapixel whole slide pathology images, RNA-seq abundance, copy number variation, and mutation data from 5,720 patients across 14 major cancer types. Our interpretable, weakly-supervised, multimodal deep learning algorithm is able to fuse these heterogeneous modalities for predicting outcomes and discover prognostic features from these modalities that corroborate with poor and favorable outcomes via multimodal interpretability. We compared our model with unimodal deep learning models trained on histology slides and molecular profiles alone, and demonstrate performance increase in risk stratification on 9 out of 14 cancers. In addition, we analyze morphologic and molecular markers responsible for prognostic predictions across all cancer types. All analyzed data, including morphological and molecular correlates of patient prognosis across the 14 cancer types at a disease and patient level are presented in an interactive open-access database (http://pancancer.mahmoodlab.org) to allow for further exploration and prognostic biomarker discovery. To validate that these model explanations are prognostic, we further analyzed high attention morphological regions in WSIs, which indicates that tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte presence corroborates with favorable cancer prognosis on 9 out of 14 cancer types studied.},

However, given the paucity of labeled histology data, direct application of MIL can easily suffer from overfitting and the network is unable to learn rich feature representations due to the weak supervisory signal. We propose to overcome such limitations with a two-stage semi-supervised approach that combines the power of data-efficient self-supervised feature learning via contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and the interpretability and flexibility of regularized attention-based MIL. We apply our two-stage CPC + MIL semi-supervised pipeline to the binary classification of breast cancer histology images. Across five random splits, we report state-of-the-art performance with a mean validation accuracy of 95% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.968. We further evaluate the quality of features learned via CPC relative to simple transfer learning and show that strong classification performance using CPC features can be efficiently leveraged under the MIL framework even with the feature encoder frozen.},

  booktitle = {2020 {IEEE} 17th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging ({ISBI})},
  abstract={Histology-based grade classification is clinically important for many cancer types in stratifying patients distinct treatment groups. In prostate cancer, the Gleason score is a grading system used to measure the aggressiveness of prostate cancer from the spatial organization of cells and the distribution of glands. However, the subjective interpretation of Gleason score often suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Previous work in deep learning-based objective Gleason grading requires manual pixel-level annotation. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised approach for grade classification in tissue micro-arrays (TMA) using graph convolutional networks (GCNs), in which we model the spatial organization of cells as a graph to better capture the proliferation and community structure of tumor cells. As node-level features in our graph representation, we learn the morphometry of each cell using a contrastive predictive coding (CPC)-based self-supervised approach. We demonstrate that on a five-fold cross validation our method can achieve 0.9659±0.0096 AUC using only TMA-level labels. Our method demonstrates a 39.80% improvement over standard GCNs with texture features and a 29.27% improvement over GCNs with VGG19 features. Our proposed pipeline can be used to objectively stratify low and high risk cases, reducing inter- and intra-observer variability and pathologist workload.},

  abstract={Although wireless capsule endoscopy is the preferred modality for diagnosis and assessment of small bowel diseases, the poor camera resolution is a substantial limitation for both subjective and automated diagnostics. Enhanced-resolution endoscopy has shown to improve adenoma detection rate for conventional endoscopy and is likely to do the same for capsule endoscopy. In this work, we propose and quantitatively validate a novel framework to learn a mapping from low-to-high resolution endoscopic images. We combine conditional adversarial networks with a spatial attention block to improve the resolution by up to factors of 8x, 10x, 12x, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative studies performed demonstrate the superiority of EndoL2H over state-of-the-art deep super-resolution methods DBPN, RCAN and SRGAN. MOS tests performed by 30 gastroenterologists qualitatively assess and confirm the clinical relevance of the approach. EndoL2H is generally applicable to any endoscopic capsule system and has the potential to improve diagnosis and better harness computational approaches for polyp detection and characterization.

  abstract={Current capsule endoscopes and next-generation robotic capsules for diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases are complex cyber-physical platforms that must orchestrate complex software and hardware functions. The desired tasks for these systems include visual localization, depth estimation, 3D mapping, disease detection and segmentation, automated navigation, active control, path realization and optional therapeutic modules such as targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Data-driven algorithms promise to enable many advanced functionalities for capsule endoscopes, but real-world data is challenging to obtain. Physically-realistic simulations providing synthetic data have emerged as a solution to the development of data-driven algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation platform for capsule endoscopy operations and introduce VR-Caps, a virtual active capsule environment that simulates a range of normal and abnormal tissue conditions (e.g., inflated, dry, wet etc.) and varied organ types, capsule endoscope designs (e.g., mono, stereo, dual and 360 camera), and the type, number, strength, and placement of internal and external magnetic sources that enable active locomotion. VR-Caps makes it possible to both independently or jointly develop, optimize, and test medical imaging and analysis software for the current and next-generation endoscopic capsule systems. To validate this approach, we train state-of-the-art deep neural networks to accomplish various medical image analysis tasks using simulated data from VR-Caps and evaluate the performance of these models on real medical data. Results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed virtual platform in developing algorithms that quantify fractional coverage, camera trajectory, 3D map reconstruction, and disease classification. All of the code, pre-trained weights and created 3D organ models of the virtual environment with detailed instructions how to setup and use the environment are made publicly available at https://github.com/CapsuleEndoscope/VirtualCapsuleEndoscopy and a video demonstration can be seen in the supplementary videos (Video-I).},
